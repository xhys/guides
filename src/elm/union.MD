# Union Types

Many languages have trouble expressing data with weird shapes. They give you a small set of built-in types, and you have to represent everything with them. So you often find yourself using null or booleans or strings to encode details in a way that is quite error prone.

Elm's union types let you represent complex data much more naturally. We will go through a couple concrete examples to build some intuition about how and when to use union types.
